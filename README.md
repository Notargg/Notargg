## Hey ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

<p> I am a Bachelor's candidate in Computer Science at the Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos (UFSCar) ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, recognized as one of Brazil's premier institutions of higher education. Currently in my final year, I anticipate graduating in December 2025.  </p>

<p> Throughout my academic journey, I have cultivated robust skills in programming, data analysis, algorithms, data structures, and artificial intelligence, applying these competencies in various academic and extracurricular projects. My participation in programming competitions and hackathons has provided me with invaluable opportunities to collaborate with peers and professionals, allowing me to explore new tools and technologies. Furthermore, I enhanced my knowledge of computing and refined my English through a summer exchange program in Cambridge.  </p>

<p> I aspire to forge a career in artificial intelligence and data science, dedicated to creating innovative and impactful solutions for society. My passion lies in continuous learning, tackling complex challenges, and collaborating within teams. I am currently seeking internship opportunities that will enable me to leverage my skills, gain new experiences, and advance my professional growth. </p>
