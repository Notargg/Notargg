## Hey ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

<p> I am a student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos (UFSCar) ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, one of the top higher education institutions in Brazil. I am in the final year of my program, with an expected graduation date in December 2025.  </p>

<p> Throughout my degree, I have developed strong skills in programming, data analysis, algorithms, data structures, and artificial intelligence, applying them in both academic and extracurricular projects. I have also participated in programming competitions and hackathons, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with other students and professionals and learn new tools and technologies. Additionally, I completed a summer exchange program in Cambridge, where I expanded my knowledge of computing and improved my English. </p>

<p>  My goal is to pursue a career in artificial intelligence and data science, contributing to the development of innovative and impactful solutions for society. I am passionate about learning new things, solving complex problems, and working in teams. I am seeking internship opportunities that will allow me to apply my skills, gain new experiences, and grow professionally. </p>
